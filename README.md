# podcast-episode-generator
Does your favorite podcast have so many episodes that you don't know how to choose which to listen to? 

This project uses the Spotify API to randomly generate an episode from any podcast you choose!

To use this random generator, you'll need to create a .env file in the same directory as
the main.py file that includes your Spotify Developers client id (set to CLIENT_ID) and client secret (set to CLIENT_SECRET).

Happy generating!
